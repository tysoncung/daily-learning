### 📝 Recommended Updates for Your Profile

Based on your GitHub profile showing you work at hivo.co as Cloud & Platform Engineering Lead, here's what I recommend:

#### 1. Headline
**Current:** [Not visible, likely needs update]

**Recommended:**
```
Cloud & Platform Engineering Lead at hivo.co | AWS, Kubernetes, AI/ML
```

**Why:** Direct, factual, includes key technologies without buzzwords

**Alternative (more casual):**
```
Building cloud infrastructure and AI systems | Perth, WA
```

#### 2. About Section
**Recommended rewrite:**
```
I build cloud infrastructure and data platforms, currently leading platform engineering at hivo.co in Perth.

Most of my work involves AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, and building internal developer platforms. I also integrate AI/ML systems into cloud applications and maintain data pipelines.

On the side, I contribute to open source projects - mainly curating resources for biostatistics, workflow automation (n8n), and cloud engineering. You can find these on my GitHub.

Previously worked at Insurance Commission of WA and other organizations in Perth and Singapore, focusing on cloud architecture, data engineering, and software development.

B.Sc Computer Science (Hons) from National University of Singapore. AWS certified (Solutions Architect, Developer, SysOps). Bilingual in English and Vietnamese. Based in Perth, WA.
```

**Why this works:**
- First-person, conversational
- Specific about what you do
- Mentions real projects (GitHub awesome lists)
- No buzzwords or marketing speak
- Natural flow, not resume-like
- Short paragraphs, easy to read

   - Specific projects and technologies
   - No percentages or vague claims

**Authenticity Goal:**
Your LinkedIn should read like you wrote it while explaining your job to a friend over coffee, not like a marketing brochure or AI-generated resume.

## How to Update LinkedIn

1. Go to https://linkedin.com/in/tysoncung
2. Click "Open to" or "Add profile section"
3. Update sections using the recommendations above
4. Review each section for buzzwords and remove them

**Remember:** Your actual work speaks for itself. The profile just needs to clearly explain what you do without the sales pitch.
