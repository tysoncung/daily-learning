## Advanced Learning: Issue Discovery Algorithms

### Created Today:
1. **Smart Issue Finder Scripts**:
   - `find-quality-issues.sh` - Shell script for finding issues in popular orgs
   - `smart-issue-finder.py` - Python script with star count filtering
   - `contribution-strategies.md` - Complete guide for finding quality issues

2. **Key Algorithms Learned**:
   - Filter by repo stars (100+) for quality
   - Check issue age (6+ hours) to avoid competition
   - Focus on 0-2 comments for better chances
   - Target documentation/typo fixes for quick wins

3. **API Rate Limiting Solutions**:
   - Use aggregator sites (goodfirstissue.dev)
   - Bookmark direct GitHub label pages
   - Spread API calls throughout the day
   - Use RSS feeds as alternative

### Top Projects to Monitor:
- **WordPress/Gutenberg** - 10 issues, very active
- **Vercel/Next.js** - 10 issues, hourly updates
- **Svelte** - Quality over quantity
- **ToolJet** - 10 issues, 2-hour freshness
- **Fastify** - 9 issues, Node.js ecosystem

## Tomorrow's Goals
- Visit goodfirstissue.dev early morning (avoid API limits)
- Pick one issue from Next.js or Gutenberg
- Contribute to documentation in a major project
- Test the new LaunchAgent scheduler
