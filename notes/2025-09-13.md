# Learning Notes - 2025-09-13

## ðŸ”¥ Day 3 - Building Momentum

## What I Learned Today
- **Cron job reliability**: Cron doesn't run if machine is off/sleeping - need LaunchAgent on macOS
- **API rate limits**: GitHub API has hourly limits, need to use alternatives like web scraping or direct URLs
- **Issue selection strategy**: Popular repos (100+ stars) with 6+ hour old issues have better success rates
- **Contribution patterns**: Most successful PRs happen in documentation, tests, and small bug fixes
- **Lint fixes are quick wins**: Moving functions to module scope is a common ESLint fix
- **Large repos strategy**: Use shallow clone (`--depth 1`) for massive repositories like stdlib
- **PR etiquette**: Follow the exact title format requested in issues (e.g., "chore: fix JavaScript lint errors (issue #8061)")

## Today's Contributions
- Set up automated daily learning system
- Created smart issue-finding algorithms
- Researched contribution strategies for popular repos
- **PR #8062**: Fixed JavaScript lint error in stdlib-js/stdlib
  - Issue: #8061 - Function needed to be moved to module scope
  - URL: https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib/pull/8062
  - Status: Updated with contributing guidelines acknowledgment âœ…
  - Coverage: 100% maintained
  - Bot feedback addressed promptly

## Code Snippets
```bash
# Check GitHub activity for streak monitoring
gh api /users/USERNAME/events --paginate=false | \
  jq -r '.[] | select(.type == "PushEvent" or .type == "PullRequestEvent") | 
  "\(.created_at | split("T")[0]) - \(.type)"'

## Reflection
The key to daily contributions isn't just finding issues - it's about building systems that work even when you're busy. The LaunchAgent setup ensures reminders even after sleep/wake cycles. The smart issue finder helps filter quality opportunities. Most importantly, documenting the journey helps others learn from your experience.
