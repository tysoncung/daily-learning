# Learning Notes - 2025-09-13

## üî• Day 3 - Building Momentum

## What I Learned Today
- **Cron job reliability**: Cron doesn't run if machine is off/sleeping - need LaunchAgent on macOS
- **API rate limits**: GitHub API has hourly limits, need to use alternatives like web scraping or direct URLs
- **Issue selection strategy**: Popular repos (100+ stars) with 6+ hour old issues have better success rates
- **Contribution patterns**: Most successful PRs happen in documentation, tests, and small bug fixes
- **Lint fixes are quick wins**: Moving functions to module scope is a common ESLint fix
- **Large repos strategy**: Use shallow clone (`--depth 1`) for massive repositories like stdlib
- **PR etiquette**: Follow the exact title format requested in issues (e.g., "chore: fix JavaScript lint errors (issue #8061)")

## Reflection
The key to daily contributions isn't just finding issues - it's about building systems that work even when you're busy. The LaunchAgent setup ensures reminders even after sleep/wake cycles. The smart issue finder helps filter quality opportunities. Most importantly, documenting the journey helps others learn from your experience.
