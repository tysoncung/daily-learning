# Learning Notes - 2025-09-17

## What I Learned Today
- **AWS CDK TypeScript**: Deep dive into AWS CDK v2 for infrastructure as code
- **Multi-Stack Architecture**: Implemented staging, production, and pipeline stacks for Jupitech website
- **Git Repository Management**: Managed private repository creation and migration from Terraform to CDK
- **CSS Design Systems**: Studied color theory and gradient design for modern web interfaces

## Code Snippets
```typescript
// AWS CDK Stack Definition Example
export class JupitechWebsiteStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: WebsiteStackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);
    
    // S3 bucket for static website hosting
    const websiteBucket = new s3.Bucket(this, 'WebsiteBucket', {
      websiteIndexDocument: 'index.html',
      websiteErrorDocument: 'error.html',
      publicReadAccess: false,
      blockPublicAccess: s3.BlockPublicAccess.BLOCK_ALL,
    });
    
    // CloudFront distribution
    const distribution = new cloudfront.Distribution(this, 'Distribution', {
      defaultBehavior: {
        origin: new origins.S3Origin(websiteBucket),
        viewerProtocolPolicy: cloudfront.ViewerProtocolPolicy.REDIRECT_TO_HTTPS,
      },
    });
  }
}
```

```bash
# CDK deployment commands learned
cdk bootstrap
cdk synth
cdk deploy --all
cdk destroy
```

## Key Projects Worked On
1. **Jupitech Website Infrastructure**: Migrated from Terraform to AWS CDK
2. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up automated deployments with CodePipeline
3. **Security Implementation**: Added WAF rules and security headers

## Resources
- AWS CDK v2 Documentation
- TypeScript best practices for infrastructure code
- CloudFront optimization techniques
- S3 static website hosting patterns

## Tomorrow's Goals
- Complete theme transformation for Jupitech website
- Add folder-inspired design elements
- Continue open source contributions
- Document deployment process
