## 💡 Key Learnings

### AWS CDK TypeScript Patterns
```typescript
// Type-safe configuration pattern learned
interface StackConfig {
  environment: string;
  region: string;
  accountId: string;
}

// Generic construct factory pattern
class ConstructFactory<T extends Construct> {
  create(scope: Construct, id: string): T {
    // Implementation
  }
}
```

### Markdown Linting Best Practices
- Always add blank lines around headings (### Title)
- Add blank lines before and after lists
- Keep line length under 80 characters for better readability
- Use consistent heading hierarchy

### GitHub Actions Optimization
- Parallel job execution improves workflow speed
- Cache dependencies to reduce build time
- Use matrix builds for multiple environments
- Implement proper error handling and retry logic
