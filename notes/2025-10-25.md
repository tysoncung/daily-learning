## Code Snippets

### Docker Health Check Configuration
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "wget", "--quiet", "--tries=1", "--spider", "http://localhost:8080/health"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 3
  start_period: 10s
```

### n8n Workflow HTTP POST Configuration
```json
{
  "parameters": {
    "method": "POST",
    "url": "={{ $env.MCP_SERVER_URL }}/api/context",
    "authentication": "none",
    "sendHeaders": true,
    "headerParameters": {
      "parameters": [
        {
          "name": "X-API-Key",
          "value": "={{ $env.MCP_API_KEY }}"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### FastAPI MCP Server Endpoint
```python
@app.post('/api/context')
async def get_context(
    query: dict,
    x_api_key: Optional[str] = Header(None)
):
    if x_api_key != 'demo-key-change-in-production':
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail='Invalid API key')

    context = {
        'query': query.get('text', ''),
        'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat(),
        'context_items': [...]
    }
    return context
```

## Reflections

Today was incredibly productive in terms of hands-on platform engineering work. The n8n-MCP integration demo turned out to be a comprehensive project that demonstrates real-world DevOps skills:

1. **Problem-Solving**: Encountered and resolved multiple issues (Docker configuration, n8n auth changes, HTTP method configuration) which improved debugging skills
2. **Documentation Excellence**: Created 4 detailed documentation files (README, ARCHITECTURE, PRESENTATION, TROUBLESHOOTING) that serve as templates for future projects
3. **Community Engagement**: Follower increase from 28 to 38 shows that active repository creation and engagement pays off
4. **Technical Depth**: Went beyond basic setup to implement proper health checks, error handling, and cross-platform compatibility

The project is now a solid portfolio piece that demonstrates:
- Container orchestration
- API integration patterns
- Workflow automation
- Technical documentation
- Production-ready code practices

Next focus should be on visibility - sharing the demo on relevant platforms and potentially creating video content to showcase the workflow in action.

**Key Takeaway**: Building complete, well-documented projects with production-ready patterns creates more value than multiple half-finished experiments. Quality over quantity in GitHub contributions.
