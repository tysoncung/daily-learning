# Learning Notes - 2025-10-28

## What I Learned Today
- Strategic GitHub account growth through authentic engagement
- Finding beginner-friendly Python issues for meaningful contributions
- Repository starring strategies for network building
- Balancing automation with genuine open source participation

## Code Snippets
```bash
# Search for good first issues in Python
gh search issues --language=python --label="good first issue" --state=open --limit=10

# Star repositories programmatically
gh api --method PUT /user/starred/owner/repo

# Check current GitHub stats
gh api user --jq '{login, followers, public_repos}'

# List your repositories with stats
gh repo list --limit 10 --json name,stargazerCount,updatedAt
```

- GitHub's "good first issue" label is reliable for finding entry points
- Automation scripts are useful but authentic contributions matter most
- Account age (7+ years) combined with consistent activity builds credibility
- Small, focused daily contributions beat sporadic large efforts

## Technical Skills Practiced
- GitHub CLI (gh) advanced search and API usage
- Bash scripting for repository automation
- GitHub reputation building strategies
- Community engagement best practices

## Resources
