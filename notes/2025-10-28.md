# Learning Notes - 2025-10-28

## What I Learned Today
- Strategic GitHub account growth through authentic engagement
- Finding beginner-friendly Python issues for meaningful contributions
- Repository starring strategies for network building
- Balancing automation with genuine open source participation

## Code Snippets
```bash
# Search for good first issues in Python
gh search issues --language=python --label="good first issue" --state=open --limit=10

# Star repositories programmatically
gh api --method PUT /user/starred/owner/repo

# Check current GitHub stats
gh api user --jq '{login, followers, public_repos}'

# List your repositories with stats
gh repo list --limit 10 --json name,stargazerCount,updatedAt
```

## Open Source Contributions
- **Starred 18+ repositories**: LLM/AI infrastructure (vllm, llama.cpp, transformers)
- **TypeScript ecosystem**: Starred modern tools (Bun, Deno, tRPC, shadcn-ui)
- **Repository maintenance**: Keeping daily-learning streak active
- **Identified contribution targets**: PyDex, SampleMind-AI, electricitymaps projects

## Daily Streak: 15 days ðŸ”¥

## TIL (Today I Learned)
- Strategic starring builds visibility in communities you care about
- GitHub's "good first issue" label is reliable for finding entry points
- Automation scripts are useful but authentic contributions matter most
- Account age (7+ years) combined with consistent activity builds credibility
- Small, focused daily contributions beat sporadic large efforts

## Technical Skills Practiced
- GitHub CLI (gh) advanced search and API usage
- Bash scripting for repository automation
- GitHub reputation building strategies
- Community engagement best practices

## Resources
- [GitHub Search API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/search)
- [Finding Good First Issues](https://github.com/topics/good-first-issue)
- PyDex Project: https://github.com/SthembisoMfusi/PyDex
- electricitymaps-contrib: https://github.com/electricitymaps/electricitymaps-contrib

## Tomorrow's Goals
- [ ] Make first contribution to PyDex (Pokemon abilities display)
- [ ] Review existing automation scripts for improvements
- [ ] Star 10 more repositories in DevOps/Platform Engineering space
- [ ] Update PROGRESS.md with today's activities
- [ ] Explore one of the electricitymaps parser issues

## Month 1 Goals Progress
- 30-day streak: 15/30 (50% complete!)
- Focus on quality over quantity
- Build genuine connections in Python/TypeScript communities
