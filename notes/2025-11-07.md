## Goals for November 2025

- [x] Maintain contribution streak (Day 19/30)
- [x] Create 4+ quality PRs ✅ (exceeded with 5 PRs in last 2 days)
- [x] Get 1+ PR merged ✅ (ragas #2405)
- [ ] Get 3+ PRs merged total
- [x] Contribute to Rust projects ✅ (nblm-rs)

## Reflections

Today focused on quality control and maintenance rather than new contributions. Key learnings:

1. **Merged PR Celebration**: The ragas formula fix merged within 24 hours - demonstrating value of simple, high-impact documentation fixes

2. **Issue Complexity Assessment**: Evaluated the ghostfolio SASS migration issue and determined it requires deeper Angular/esbuild expertise than initially apparent. Better to acknowledge complexity than commit to incomplete work.

3. **Community Management**: Successfully updated the awesome-vibe-coding PR based on maintainer feedback, now has 2 approvals and awaiting final merge.

4. **Strategic Focus**: With 20 open PRs across different projects, maintaining awareness of review status is as important as creating new contributions.

The streak continues with a focus on sustainable, quality contributions rather than volume.
